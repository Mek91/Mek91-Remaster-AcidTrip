# Mek91-Remaster-AcidTrip

My purpose of doing this is that the old one was playing over the id of the video as youtube api and since it was an old system, this system prevented you from playing copyrighted music as far as I understood, so I overcame this situation in this way and shared it. In this system, you can either put it next to it, but you need to place it in the files section in fxmanifest.lua, otherwise it will not work, either upload it to any file hosting service and put its url in index.html and run it.
